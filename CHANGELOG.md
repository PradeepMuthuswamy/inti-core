# Inticore Estimation Automation - Changelog

## Major Updates - October 2025

### ðŸ”§ Fixed Critical Issues

#### 1. **STL Unit Detection Issue**

- **Problem**: STL file was being read in meters but treated as millimeters, causing volume to be 1 billion times too large
- **Solution**: Added automatic unit detection based on volume and bounding box dimensions
- **Impact**: Volume now correctly shows ~862 mmÂ³ instead of 862 million mmÂ³

#### 2. **Material Density Not Applied**

- **Problem**: Material selection (Steel vs Aluminum) was not being used in weight calculations
- **Solution**: Fixed material density to be properly passed from user selection to calculation
- **Impact**: Steel parts now correctly use 7.85 g/cc instead of 2.68 g/cc

#### 3. **Random Hole Detection**

- **Problem**: Hole count was randomly generated (showing 18 holes for a screw!)
- **Solution**: Removed random generation, now returns 0 until proper hole detection is implemented
- **Impact**: No more false hole counts

#### 4. **Tooling Cost Formula**

- **Problem**: Formula was `(volume_mm3 / 1000000) * 1000000 = volume_mm3`, making costs unrealistic
- **Solution**: Replaced with size-based base costs:
  - Small parts (< 50mm): â‚¹50,000
  - Medium parts (50-100mm): â‚¹100,000
  - Large parts (100-300mm): â‚¹500,000
  - XL parts (> 300mm): â‚¹2,000,000
- **Impact**: Tooling costs now realistic and amortized properly

### ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Improvements

#### 1. **Simplified Navigation**

- Changed from sidebar to tab-based navigation
- 3 main tabs: Estimate | Rate Cards | History
- All functionality accessible in one view

#### 2. **Compact Layout**

- Combined upload and configuration in one page
- Results display immediately below configuration
- Better space utilization

#### 3. **One-Click Processing**

- Single "Calculate Estimate" button does everything
- Progress indicator during processing
- Automatic results display

#### 4. **Editable Rate Cards**

- New "Rate Cards" tab for editing all pricing
- Changes apply immediately to new estimates
- No more hardcoded values
- Reset button to restore defaults

### ðŸ“Š Enhanced Features

#### 1. **Calculation Steps Display**

- Collapsible expander with all calculation steps
- Shows formulas and reasoning
- Easy to verify calculations

#### 2. **Better State Management**

- Persistent rate cards in session state
- Results remain visible until new estimate
- No navigation required between tabs

#### 3. **Improved Data Display**

- Part properties in clean table format
- Cost breakdown in pie chart
- All metrics visible at once

### ðŸŽ¯ What's Configurable Now

All pricing can be edited in the Rate Cards tab:

1. **Material Rates**

   - Density (g/cc)
   - Cost per kg (â‚¹)
   - Yield percentage (%)

2. **Machining Rates** (â‚¹/hour)

   - VMC, HMC, CNC Turning, Drilling

3. **Finishing Costs** (â‚¹/piece)

   - Anodized, Coated, Polished, As_Cast

4. **Testing Costs** (â‚¹/piece)

   - Leak Test, X-Ray, Dimensional Check, None

5. **Other Parameters**
   - Overhead percentage
   - Scrap allowance percentage

### ðŸ”„ Next Steps (Future Improvements)

1. **Proper Hole Detection**

   - Implement actual hole detection algorithm
   - Consider using CAD analysis libraries

2. **Manual Part Data Entry**

   - Allow users to override detected values
   - Add manual hole count input

3. **Export to Excel/PDF**

   - Professional quotation format
   - Detailed cost breakdown reports

4. **Rate Card Import/Export**

   - Save rate card configurations
   - Load different rate sets for different scenarios

5. **Multi-part Estimates**
   - Process multiple files at once
   - Assembly cost calculation

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with your DIN 908 screw file - should now show realistic values
2. Try different materials (Steel vs Aluminum) - verify density changes
3. Edit rate cards - confirm calculations update correctly
4. Check calculation steps - verify all formulas are correct
